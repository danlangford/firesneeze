      <DefaultText>This is the Shadow Clock. You'll find Xanesha or one of her faceless here. Or she may be at one of her other hunting grounds around the city.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>If you fight her head on, make sure to land the first blow quickly.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>You can count on it. Now it's time you leave the Lost Coast for good.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>4</ID>
      <DefaultText>That is a certainty. You are no longer welcome in the Lost Coast. It is time you depart.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>5</ID>
      <DefaultText>To be sure. Your captivity means less to me than stopping Xanesha. Leave the Lost Coast now and forever more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I don't intend to give her a chance to surrender. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>7</ID>
      <DefaultText>That is my preferred style. It's time you leave. I find out you're anywhere in the Lost Coast after this, you're a dead man.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>You speak of understood things. You must go now. The Lost Coast is no longer home to the framer of faces.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>Duly noted. I would take this opportunity to find another home far away from the Lost Coast.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>I'll be quick enough. Don't you worry. You, on the other hand, need to be doubly quick in getting yer arse out of the Lost Coast 'fore I start changin' my mind.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>You have served your part. It is time for you to leave the Lost Coast. For good.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>You have illuminated the threat satisfactorily. Consider yourself exiled from the Lost Coast. It is under Sarenrae's protection, and you are not welcome.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>While this doesn't forgive all of your sins, it is first step. If I find that you have lost your way again, Iomedae's justice will be swift.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>She is fond of places that foster greed. So you'll find her influence where there is religion and commerce.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>Our next meeting will not be so amicable. </DefaultText>

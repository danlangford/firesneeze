      <DefaultText>So you defeated Jubrayl, and you apprehended me. At last, Sandpoint is safeâ€¦ Ha!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I can't wait to tell Ameiko! You, my rotund and venomous adversary, have inspired me to compose a comedy about dandy rogue Jugrail Whiskey and his bumbling dimwitted sidekick, Pitbug!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You weren't the only one laughing! Wish it had been more of a challenge. Taking your traps apart was too easy a job to pass up! I've seen better trigger mechanisms whipped up by Birdcruncher goblins.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>That is the wrong question, fool! A poison has been running through the veins of this town long before I crafted a single brew.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I see! A rich guy hired you and Jubrayl to create chaos around town, in preparation for some other intrigue...
Well, I can't say this wasn't fun! But I've got a date to keep at the Rusty Dragon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ah... Even though my venom was top notch, the traps were second-rate? Trust an aristocrat to be stingy with the tools he provides...</DefaultText>

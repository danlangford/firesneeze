      <DefaultText>We've finally arrived at Sandpoint! This place looks quieter than it did my dreams. 

Of course, looks may be deceiving.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You there! You look equipped and able! I can't get a supply shipment past the waterfront these days. That brigand Jubrayl Vhiski and his thugs are robbing honest folks in the streets. Our incompetent sheriff can't seem to do a thing about it!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sandpoint: It will be a relief to be far from the politics of Absalom. 

It is said the ruins of old Thassilon can be found here. Given peace and time, I could learn much.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>So this is Sandpoint. Doesn't seem like much. 

I bet there's a place to get a drink or three... and some soft company while we're at it.</DefaultText>

Be happy when this place is at my back... too many walls for one to breathe.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I guess it &lt;i&gt;sounds&lt;/i&gt; like a noble enough cause. This isn't quite what I envisioned... but every journey has to start somewhere.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I did not come here to dispose of thugs, but ridding this town of its criminal element is worth the time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I couldn't agree more! Perhaps I will compose a song when all is said and done. 

What rhymes with Vhiski?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I have followed the breadcrumbs of my sister's disappearance here to Sandpoint. It is likely to be another disappointment. Nothing is gained without trial.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There's been a lot of chatter about the "longshanks" who killed so many of them in Sandpoint. Seems like you've made an impression. If it will help quell the goblin threat, I will join you in this fight.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There's been a lot of chatter about the "longshanks" who killed so many of them in Sandpoint. Seems like you've made an impression. I will scout the periphery. Anyone deciding to join the fight from outside will find themselves full of arrows.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though Thistletop is covered in brambles and crude fortifications, something ancient and perhaps sinister lies below. These goblins are merely a distraction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Thistletop looks to have natural cover in all of those brambles. You can't see 'em, but that brush is crawlin' with goblins.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Five goblin tribes? Is that all? And I was afraid that a clever quip and a song wouldn't be enough to win the day. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nualia's plans seem directed at Sandpoint. Could this be the start of something even larger?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Five? I don't know why goblins like Noolia so much. She must scare them more than humans or heroes.</DefaultText>

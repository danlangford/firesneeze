      <DefaultText>I’ve got my men stationed there now, but the thing that bothers me isn’t the fact that we have two dead bodies inside. It’s the fact that this is actually the second set of murders we’ve had in the last few days.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It seems that Nualia was right. Something else has come to terrify Sandpoint in her place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This is most curious. These murders have transpired mere days after Nualia fell with proclamations of further vengeance coming to Sandpoint.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You have come to the right halfling, Sheriff. I will begin investigating without delay. I will also send word to the Pathfinder Society. They may have resources that can help.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I come to you for help in this matter—my men are good, but they are also green. They were barely able to handle themselves against the goblins, and what we’re facing now is an evil far worse than goblins. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>If these are connected to Nualia's conspiracies, this is not surprising, as we are the architects of her demise.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I think this note was left to throw suspicion onto you. I am keeping word of this note quiet for now. There are a few leads you might look into.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>First, let me thank you again for all you’ve done for Sandpoint. It’s fortunate you’ve proven yourselves so capable, because we’ve a problem I think you can help us with. Put simply, we have a murderer in our midst—one who, I fear, has only begun his work.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Three con men from the town of Galduria were found murdered in an abandoned barn south of town a few days ago—their bodyguard, Grayst, survived the assault but has gone insane and was sent to Habe’s Sanatorium.</DefaultText>
